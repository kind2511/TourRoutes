## Project Structure

Our project is divided into frontend and backend components:

- **frontend/**: Contains our React frontend code. This is the user-facing part of our application.
  
- **backend/**: Manages the back end of the application including the API, database connections, and other server-side tasks.

Root directory files:
- `.gitignore`: Lists files and folders we don't want Git to track.
- `README.md`: This very document!
